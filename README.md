# Decentralized Review System (Plugin)
A Chrome Peer Review Plugin connecting to Ethereum Blockchain

# Installation

Install necessary dependencies and dev-dependencies
```shell
npm install 
```

# Development 

Open one terminal, and run watchify.js to constantly watching for changes and automatically run `npm run build` on browerify.js 
```shell
npm run watch
```

Now whenever a change is made, the extension will be automatically updated, so does the `bundle.js` where all required packages and js files reside.
